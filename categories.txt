Convincing
  when the model looks like a pretty good fit to the lens -- leaving little doubt that it is a lens.
Plausible
  if the model looks like it's on the right track, but needs improvement.
MayBe
  if not so convided that lens
Uncertain
  when the modelling was unsuccessful, or doesn't look right. (Not a lens?)
RatherNot
  quite sure its no lens
Complicated
  when the system does look like a lens, but the modelling software has difficulties with it.
Strange
  for example red arc
NoModels
  no models available
